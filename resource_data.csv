ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Enterprise Form Manager August 2013 to Present Members:Jessica Claire Form management application that allow administrative users to create, manage, and maintain dynamically generated forms.
As our administrators are not typically familiar with HTML and relying on developer turnaround for custom forms, I created this system to allow our users to create forms including custom fields, labels, validation and form content.
This is managed via a friendly interface that on saving, auto-generates html that is served publicly.
Team Foundation Server April 2014 to Present Members:Jessica Claire Migrated the team from Visual Source Safe to Team Foundation Server.
Most recently upgraded the division's TFS instance to 2012.
Began to implement system as task tracking and resource planning to help my team leads and management better manage projects and day-to-day support efforts.
IDIQ Vehicle Management Portal November 2012 to June 2013 Members:Jessica Claire, Eric Sellers Developed web portal used by IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity) Vehicle management site used to track ongoing and up coming government proposals.
Allows tracking, reporting, and collaboration amongst the company and its partners to support proposal development and reporting for current contracts.
Built in MVC.NET, using Kendo UI, Unity, Entity Framework and a number of additional technologies.
NuGet Managed Enterprise Library January 2014 to Present Members:Jessica Claire, Eric Sellers Creation and continuing improvement of a shared enterprise library to be used by the entire development staff.
Centralizes and abstract coming and reusable code to better support rapid application development and reduce redundant code.
Libraries include a number of interface and implementations to support IoC pattern, repository pattern, Entity Framework, consistent error logging, automatic timezone conversions, system-wide database auditing, etc.
Implemented in a custom NuGet gallery to allow quick and easy access while, more importantly, preventing copies of similar code from littering our numerous applications we support.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Notable accomplishments in Materials Science Research and Development: -

I have the formal educational training necessary in metallurgical Engineering of Materials and worked for over 30 years in industry performing aerospace related work as a manufacturing, production, Process Engineer, a Senior Engineer an independent successful engineer consultant to Industries in North America. I have been certified by the State of Colorado Higher Education to developed college level curriculum of instruction and teach college integrated circuit ( IC) fabricated courses : Diffusion processes, Thin film, Ion Implantation, Plasma Etching and the related Safety courses to college students. Beside being an Engineer of Materials Prime Aerospace, , Aeronautics, Automotive, batteries fuel cell, Nuclear, Medical devices, Semiconductor, Power and Propulsion generating Industry. As a successful Research Scientist I have experienced break through, earned awards of European and American grant of patents, I have published cited works in Peers Reviewed Journals, presented invited Technical Seminars to Industries, Colorado School of Mines Postgraduate Engineering Students and Faculties and at international Conference Proceedings, in Cincinnati, Ohio , to name a few. The rest of my work experience are documented elsewhere in my resume making qualified to perform the work that I am currently applying for.


1.At the University of Birmingham, Edgbaston Birmingham England, where I studied, I developed a world first small type electrochemical cell capable of use for electro-depositing coherent binary, ternary or quaternary alloy films of intermediate at weight % metal composition on the aluminum, stainless steel or titanium substrate from aqueous solution of simple salt without the use of metalloids of cyanide.

(a)Designed and invented a novel electrochemical cell used for electrochemical studies of kinetics and thermodynamic reactions of metal/alloy deposition containing intermediate binary, Ternary or quaternary alloys composition of intermediate from aqueous solution and explained the phenomenon of anomalous behavior of metal alloy films during certain times of electro-deposition process.

(b) I had successfully developed novel slurry paste made up of metal-polymer alloy composites incorporated with organic plasticizers and dispersants grade of grade of polymers electrodes suitable for secondary rechargeable porous battery for aerospace and space missions.


2.At Colson Caster Corporation: I successfully formulated and applied a novel chemical solution used by Colson Caster Corporation for neutralization of stubborn toxic fume pollution from the Oil quenching Metal Heat Treating media in the Work Shop, to comply with the OSHA regulation.

3.At Alcoa Howmet Power and Propulsion in White Hall, MI, My first project was to lead the Engineering group in vacuum furnace heat treatment and Brazing processes. The furnaces were known arch, improper brazing, Heat treatment, compromised brazing atmospheric condition, improper temperature spread as noticed during the temperature uniformity survey. The condensed outgas organic and inorganic species (sublimation) on reversal formed on the cold graphite vacuum furnace walls/heating elements eroding them. Introduction of argon atmosphere into the vacuum furnace caused felled back on the aerospace brazed or heat treated components in the Inconel heat treat basket causing localized eutectic melting on the parts causing million of nonconformance products that could not be reworked. I had explained the above and that the chemical reaction was a natural surface phenomena particularly if the work was done in hard vacuum or a vacuum atmospheric that was lower than the vapor pressure of the out gas materials. For mitigation, I suggested that, unless; it was specified by the customer, adequate vacuum pressure should be used and periodic PM schedule for maintaining the furnace be initiated and maintained. These was adopted by the company and upon implementation lengthened the shelf life expectation of the furnaces, increased product throughput, eliminated scrap generation, reworks improved product quality for airworthiness applications, enhanced on time product shipments to customers making them happy and with the potential of saving the company over 1 million dollars; per year.

4.At GE –I was the lead Aerospace specialist Engineer who successfully led the company to vacuum braze aerospace back-shell assemblies, the ceramic metal igniter components and the metal – alumina otherwise known as metal to glass interface fusion (brazing) from vacuum furnace for aerospace hermetically Sealed Sensor development program. I rewrote the brazing instructions, defined the inter metal diameter clearance to enhance capillary action flows of the filler metal to 80% required braze diffusion bonding penetration depth.

5.Eagle Picher Industries Inc., Designed and participated in the R&D supported for Eagle-Picher Industries Inc., in the selection of critical polymer-metal powder composite chemistries used in developing recharge able Ni-Cad, Nickel –Iron (Ni-Fe-H2) hydrogen, Ni/Fe and Lithium thionyl chloride (ALTC) power battery successfully developed for NASA Space Flight Missions Program, dual shaft electric propulsion vehicle and unique artillery applications. In collaboration with our Team at Eagle Picher in Colorado Springs, Colorado, DOW Chemicals supplied the raw polymer materials supplies for the battery development project whilst Sandia National Laboratories and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) tested the porous battery cells conduction. The Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd) rechargeable battery developed was responsible for supplying power to the magnetosphere probe used for NASA’s IMAGE Space Craft. This power-producer (Ni-Cad) will operate when the probe is in darkness. Otherwise, the probe operates on solar power while the battery is recharging in space.

6.(c) One of the achievements I experienced at the above company, was that in collaboration with Dow Chemical Company in Michigan, I designed and successfully applied some novel slurry pastes compound made up of metal-polymer alloy composites incorporated with organic plasticizers, and dispersants suitable for an Aerospace-secondary rechargeable porous advanced battery electrodes. The Battery’s power output was tested by The Sandia National Laboratory and found to be an improved advanced satellite battery fuel cell.

EXPERIENCE
04/2008 to PRESENT
SR. PROJECT MANAGER AND SR. BUSINESS ANALYST
Crane Worldwide Logistics
At Thermo Fisher Scientific working in the Digital Technology Delivery team, I work as Portfolio Manager, Project Manager and as a business analyst.
I am responsible for eCommerce Portfolio Management as the lead project manager of a $10M budget to relocate our enterprise data center that houses over 4k host systems ranging from ERP, CRM, Sales Tools, E-Commerce, and other back office applications to AWS cloud and our on premise corporate headquarters.
I recently closed out a project where I forecasted and maintained the budget of $2M, 36 employees, and 1 year duration to re-platform website search for our enterprise e-Commerce website search engine.
I delivered on-time and within budget.
Prior to this I owned the B2B channel operations and portfolio for 66% of our overall web revenue equating to $600M annually at the time.
As owner of the channel portfolio, I organized C & B level summits that defined the roadmap for the year, half or quarter's activities across many functional groups.
Within the portfolio management I established processes and policies for establishing and obtaining budget, setting priorities for the projects that were initialized along with operational enhancements and defect resolution or continuous improvement.
I ensure the business case justifies our spend, has measurable performance metrics to ensure projects delivered are tracking to the forecasted returns or savings for the organization.
I produce business and functional requirement documents using UML, context diagrams and use case diagrams.
I have used DMAIC Six Sigma approaches, Continuous Improvement, Iterative, Waterfall and Agile practices to manage SDLC projects and programs.
I produce waterfall project plans as well as Agile story cards and sprints as my role as a project manager.
I present project charters, forecast and track cross functional budgets and schedule for assets, travel, vendors engagement, licensing, on-shore and off-shore resources.
A cadence of capacity planning for both internal full time employees, temps, and contractors across functional teams like ERP, eCommerce, CRM architects/developers and quality assurance resources.
I have coordinated and conducted stakeholder meetings, touch-base meetings, sprints, summits/strategy/tactical meetings, follow ups, deep dives and status/ROI report outs all where applicable for multimillion dollar projects and operational activities.
05/2001 to 04/2008
SR & STAFF ENGINEER
QUALCOMM
Architected, designed, and implemented systems for large Enterprise projects such as Security Management, CRM, Supply Chain, Employee Management, Issue Tracking, Portal Development, and Document Management.
I managed resources and deliverables for aggressive timelines.
Leading implementation efforts and mentored development staff in best practices, design patterns and principles.
Key player for recommendations and interviewing of candidates for permanent and contract positions (domestic and foreign).
Reviewed quality of deliverables produced by external consulting firms, advising as necessary.
Key Project Accomplishments: Gathered and refined business requirements, translated business requirements into functional requirements including use-cases.
Using Java along with Business Objects implemented and delivered an on-time and on-budget sales tool to track company product presale information needed for marketing and supply chain.
The data captured by the tool identifies the target market, the operator, the infrastructure that the product will be utilized in, what version of hardware and software are a best fit based on the needs of the customer driven by data entered into the tool, the form factors of the manufactured product, the geographical location of the targeted market, sales person information and weekly status of the person that is working the account, customer contact information and other data, and many other aspects that assist our sales, marketing, and business analysts to make future company road map decisions.
Using the popular Documentum (WDK and DFC) Framework I designed automation for many aspects of document management and B2B needs.
Our products have vast amounts of documentation for many different audiences and paradigms such as user manuals, technical specifications, testing procedures and outcomes, as well as some aspects of how to manufacture the products that are designed by Qualcomm.
My system manages the security and audit information around these documents, the lifecycle of the documentation, the workflows associated with the documentation and the notifications sent to Customers, Foundries and Engineers.
This is an internal tool as well as a B2B solution.
To implement this tool I utilized many additional frameworks such as Struts, JSTL, Tiles, Oracle Identity Management, Log4J, WebServices, XML to name a few.
Using Informatica, Business Objects, Oracle 10g with XMLDB I architected and designed a system that extracts data from our engineering design tools, organizes it into 3rdNF ODS, and then ETLs into a Star Schema Data Warehouse.
I report the results of Qualcomm design into a library of reports that are used as a interface for our foundries, lead designers and company executives.
This tool is said to have the ROI of ""the business itself"".
This tool has saved Qualcomm many millions of dollars by exposing design anomalies that would not have been uncovered until our product was fabricated and tested or released to market.
The tool was so important and popular that it has spun off a new business separate but partnered with Qualcomm.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Induced Overexpression of Transformed E. coli Protein and Protein Purification Assays— Genetic engineering and Analytical chemistry
Over a span of 3 months, I targeted a particular genomic sequence within a specific lineage of E. coli cells. Using oligonucleotide primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), I cloned fragments of DNA that contained the target sequence. Through restriction enzyme digestion and subsequent ligation into the MCS of the designed and manufactured plasmid vector. I was able to transfect a separate target E. coli strain using electroporation and heat shock treatments. With a sequence encoding for an antibiotic resistance induced into the genetically modified bacterial strains, I selected for these cell lineages that both encoded the resistance and the target protein sequence. After exposure to transcription factors, constitutive production of my target protein was achieved. Additionally, I used DEAE anion exchange amongst other commonly used protein purification methods to isolate my genetically engineered/ man-made target protein (alkaline phosphatase). Finally, a kinetic analysis was performed to verify that the target protein was indeed isolated and functional. This assay verified the success of this methodology of genetic engineering.

Wts International, Inc.
Transferred internal and external calls and communications for the facility Managed the facilities logs, waitlists, work orders and OPERA program BP JUNIPER TOPSIDES R430 DISTRIBUTED CONTROL SYSTEM The Juniper project will develop resources from the Corallita and Lantana fields located in the Columbus Basin, located approximately 52 miles east of Galeota Point, Trinidad.
An unmanned platform, Juniper, consolidates the product from new wells.
The Integrated Control and Safety System (ICSS) is a total system which will include the logic solvers for the Basic Process Control System (BPCS), Safety Instrumented System (SIS), Over Pressure Protection System (OPPS), Fire and Gas (F&G) System, Subsea Control Unit (SCU), the Subsea Master Control System (MCS;by others), associated process servers and Human Machine Interface (HMI) devices.
Normal operation is from the existing Mahogany B platform.
ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY WATERFLOODING DESIGN AND ANALYSIS This project was directed toward using numerical simulation to study water flooding design.
The objective is to use Eclipse-100 to study the behavior of a quarter of a five spot pattern subject to water flooding with varying mobility ratios.
In the sensitivity analysis I used the mobility ratio determine the effect it has on the areal sweep efficiency at breakthrough, the pore volumes of oil produced at breakthrough, the fractional flow of water at breakthrough and the time it takes for breakthrough to actually occur.
In this project, given isolated reservoir properties, I constructed a 3D reservoir model using the Eclipse and Petrel programs.
Once rendered, I could then place production and injection wells throughout the reservoir to determine which well placement pattern was the most cost effective.
Several combinations of patterns with primary production methods were used in the different layers of the heterogeneous anisotropic reservoir to determine the most efficient and cost effective method to produce and complete this reservoir before even drilling the wells.
In this project I designed and analyzed the field handling of produced fluids (satellites with headers/test separators/transfer pumps type and size), all flow lines and injection distribution lines, the main battery design (separation, oil treating, produced water handling, vapor recovery design/compressor specs), spill prevention plan, oil sales plans, gas sales, injection pump and related equipment design and the fresh water supply wells.

SUMMARY
I am an Automation Developer with a love for troubleshooting and electronics. This passion for automation started at Micro Center in 2017, where I began finding ways to simplify my reports to upper management. These reports took several hours to compile and took the time I could have spent guiding my agents. Eventually, I started finding ways to gather that data through an API. After discovering I could collect this information and use APIs to simplify tasks, I started programming software to do these things. This new skill helped change how I approached my team's problems & complaints and eventually led to me creating tools to improve our efficiency and productivity. Since then, my passion has grown into a career that keeps me wanting to learn more.

Worked extensively on Databases, handling reporting for data more than 700GB.
Developer Analytics team for a project on big data mining and analysis providing a cloud solution that collects logs, exceptions and then using machine learning, algorithms to categorize and present this data to help the developers of Azure applications to figure out earlier unknown errors.
Platform Creation on Azure for the entire Marketing portfolio in Microsoft such that is maximizes scalability, availability and cost-efficiency.
Migration of Employee Data Management to Azure which is a global launch of employee self-service transactions and manager self-service transactions.
Have done 9 weeks of internship at Microsoft, Hyderabad from May, 2011 to July, 2011.

Also performed Regression Testing and Performance Testing on the applications developed by the organization.
Paper Presentations: Presented a paper, ""Data transfer using Wi-Fi - Methods, Security and Applications"" in an International Conference ""Advances in Computer and Communication Technology"" held in Mumbai conducted by the IETE.
Projects Done: Final Year Project - Vicinity File Drop A solution to eradicate the use of pen-drives, hard disks and other storage devices in order to transfer data between devices in close proximity using Wi-Fi.
Initially, an Ad-hoc network is set up and the nodes that are in vicinity (within Wi-Fi range of each other) are identified.
The file is encrypted at the sender's side and sent and is decrypted at the receiver's side.
The encryption/decryption is done using the AES algorithm and other security issues like Spoofing, Sybil attack are reduced in the application.
The data is sent much faster and in a secure manner with an easy-to-use interface Mini - Projects Network Sniffer"" Created an application using C# that gives the information of all packets being transmitted over the network that are using TCP or UDP.
The captured information is decoded from raw digital form into a human-readable format that permits users of the application to easily review the exchanged information.
The Network Sniffer monitors the network and it measures the amount and type of traffic on the particular network.
Information is extracted from packet headers and displayed on the basis of user settings such as filters, time, etc.
Development of an Air Traffic Control System"" Created an interface for the air traffic controller that manages all landing, taking off and passing-by flights in the given air space using Visual Basic as the front end and created the database in Oracle for fast query retrieval.
The system automatically transfers the control of the flight from the air controller to the ground controller once the flight has landed to be directed to the correct parking bay and vice versa when the flight is ready to take off.
Performance of String Search Algorithms on Heterogeneous Computing (CPU/GPU) platforms"" Implemented two algorithms namely, Brute Force and Boyer-Moore using normal conventional programming and tested the performance of each.
Attempted to implement the same using CUDA on the GPU platform and found that the Boyer Moore execution is much faster and can be parallelized to a greater extent.
Major Achievements: Gold Medalist of the university in the Information Technology branch for securing the 1st rank amongst more than 300 students.

Work Experience
Data Scientist, Tech Director & DBA of CiteSeerX, 06/2013 to Present
State Of Louisiana – Ville Platte, LA, USA
I started with the web crawling module of CiteSeerX in 2011, then expanded to the full architecture around 2013.
My job duties include administrating the MySQL database and Apache Solr index servers, hacking the source code (Python/Java/Perl) to fix security vulnerabilities, developing new web application features, managing 100+ terabytes production and research data, maintaining 30+ physical and virtual servers to facilitate production and research, and developing software to improve web crawling, information classification and extraction.
By the end of 2014, I was able to run the entire search engine single handed.
In 2015, I proposed infrastructure and software solutions to overcome scalability bottlenecks and blueprinted the next generation of CiteSeerX.
By the end of 2016, I had scaled the data collection from 3 million to over 10 million documents.
Currently, the system can keep running for several months without major issues.
The 200+ page system document wrote by me significantly flattens learning curve for new admins.
I used to assist 3+ professors to build private cloud and GPU infrastructure.
I also have experience of working on a Hadoop cluster, and programming with MapReduce.

Profile
I was employed as a HW Design Engineer from 2007 to now speciaClairezing in FPGA design for Telecommunication products at Fujitsu Network Communications. During this period of time, I participated in all phases of FPGA development from the conceptual stages to high volume production releases for different product Clairenes. My first project was on an Altera FPGA and I was able to meet all the deadClairenes of this FPGA. My second project was part of a 10G Ethernet traffic management FPGA. I was responsible for a high speed memory interface controller implemented in a high-end XiClairenx FPGA. This was the project which brought me into the high speed world and I saw many problems in the area of signal integrity and timing which I have never seen before. I was fascinated by the high speed world and it inspired me to invent a dynamic high speed QDRII+ memory controller caClairebration method which was patented in both U.S and Japan. My strong capabiClairety was recognized by the company and since then I was appointed as the FPGA lead and so far I have been successfully led two FPGA projects. One was a 10G OTN transponder system with FPGA served as an OTN overhead processor. I successfully led the team to deClairever all the features on time even with some of the unexpected staff change in the middle of the project. The other project was a SoC system with a single IC containing both ARM processors and programmable logic served in the control plane of an 800G Date Center Interconnect system. The team I led successfully completed the design and testing within 6 months which became the first FPGA project in the company which was completed in the shortest amount of time.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Customer Service
I moved from a CSR position into EDI because I offered to watch the EDI transmissions at a company I worked for. My analysis of specs and the data led to me pointing out incoming data that wasn't being mapped, that we CSRs had to call for daily. My interest in programming led me to move on to positions of increasing responsibility in EDI.
In my current EDI Specialist position, I log into 4 accounts daily to do Daily Ops/make sure time critical data is processing correctly. When there are issues, I analyze the data to determine the root cause, suggesting corrective action for future data. I manipulate the data and/or alter X12 maps to get the transactions processed and sent.
I provide on call support for 15 clients, providing mapping and setup support for new and existing trading partners. When there is a system problem I research and resolve or get their IT support staff involved.
I train and develop How To guides so my clients can get comfortable with their translation software and EDI data.

Principal Engineer
Verizon Communications – Dulles, VA
F/A-22 Program Served as a member of the Avionics Integration Lab (AIL) Stability Team, as well as Diagnostics and Health Management (DHM) Lead.  As a Stability Team member, I performed statistical analyses comparing lab performance to avionics performance on the aircraft.  Such analyses were throughout the program, including to design a model, using current metrics data from the AIL, with the intent of predicting performance in Flight Test; to examine outstanding problem reports; and, using defined criteria, propose which software changes would have the most impact - ones that would positively impact the stability metric, with the least amount of variability.
07/2000 to 07/2001
Principal Engineer
Verizon Communications – Duluth, MN
Supported Avionics Integration for the F-22 Avionics Integration Laboratory.
Responsible for the test and integration of the Inertial Reference System/ global position system with the F-22 avionics.

Principal Engineer
Verizon Communications – Durham, NC
Previously on this program, I held various positions, including Lead for the Software Support Team.  My team was responsible for maintaining documented software problems concerning products delivered from up to 30 subcontractors.  One challenge was to maintain these databases on multiple levels of system securities.  I wrote the process, still in use (program-wide), that maintains customer access to data needed to solve problems, without compromising program security.
I also supported the AIL as a Communication, Navigation, and Interrogation (CNI) focal.  As such, I wrote scenarios to test various CNI capabilities in the AIL.
01/1984 to 01/1996
Principal Engineer
Abbott Laboratories – Boston, MA
I spent 12 years supporting CAS in many different capacities.
After one year with the company, I became a Lead, a position I held for my duration at CAS.  My group was responsible for software Verification and Validation; working with software used on our Automatic Test Station for line replaceable units (LRUs) and shop replaceable units (SRUs).  This software, written in Atlas, BASIC, and FORTRAN, required proficiency in all three.  We also worked with the Atlas Compiler and Operating System.
Later in the program, part of a cost cutting and process improvement effort, I led a team involved in eliminating the software verification group.  The people, already quite knowledgeable in software and test, became software designers, and I went on to work more process improvements.
As a result of my efforts in CAS, we were able to improve our on-time delivery of software from 30% to 100% for three years in a row.

Such analyses were throughout the program, including to design a model, using current metrics data from the AIL, with the intent of predicting performance in Flight Test; to examine outstanding problem reports; and, using defined criteria, propose which software changes would have the most impact - ones that would positively impact the stability metric, with the least amount of variability.

Previously on this program, I held various positions, including Lead for the Software Support Team.  My team was responsible for maintaining documented software problems concerning products delivered from up to 30 subcontractors.  One challenge was to maintain these databases on multiple levels of system securities.  I wrote the process, still in use (program-wide), that maintains customer access to data needed to solve problems, without compromising program security.
I also supported the AIL as a Communication, Navigation, and Interrogation (CNI) focal.  As such, I wrote scenarios to test various CNI capabilities in the AIL.

I spent 12 years supporting CAS in many different capacities.
After one year with the company, I became a Lead, a position I held for my duration at CAS.  My group was responsible for software Verification and Validation; working with software used on our Automatic Test Station for line replaceable units (LRUs) and shop replaceable units (SRUs).  This software, written in Atlas, BASIC, and FORTRAN, required proficiency in all three.  We also worked with the Atlas Compiler and Operating System.
Later in the program, part of a cost cutting and process improvement effort, I led a team involved in eliminating the software verification group.  The people, already quite knowledgeable in software and test, became software designers, and I went on to work more process improvements.
As a result of my efforts in CAS, we were able to improve our on-time delivery of software from 30% to 100% for three years in a row.","MS Excel, MS Project, MS Word, MS PowerPoint. Familiar with MS Access.

Within Agile software development model, I worked as a Java developer of the scrum team, develop and implement the Type and Attribute management in the PTC Windchill J2EE application server system. The Type and Attribute management manages the type definitions and attribute definitions for all business objects in PTC Windchill PDM software. All those implementations were completed on test-driven development mode. The new features were tested by automatic tests, e.g. Junit test, Junit integration tests, in Jenkins integration server. Based on Model-View-Controller(MVC) developing pattern, implement the server side's type and attribute management system with Java program. Use the Rose data modeling tool to create the type and attribute model, and persist this model data into database by Windchill JDBC application API. Developed server side view/cache mechanism to keep the model data in the memory cache. Based on MVC pattern, develop and implement the attribute enumeration management with data model, cache and view mechanism in the Windchill J2EE application server. Develop and implement XML exporter/importer to export/import the type and attribute definitions by XML files with Java program. Develop and implement external enumeration provider to enhance the enumeration management. Develop and implement type and attribute manager service API for type manager client UI.

Worked as a key member of the Extended Data Access group to design, develop and support the cryptography security system on Unisys mainframe. Served as the major programmer in the performance applications and other projects. Designed a JCE provider on ClearPath mainframe system. This JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) is implemented by Java program and Java Native Interface (JNI). It supports the major cryptography algorithms including AES, Triple DES, DES and MD5. Implemented a cipher command-line program with this JCE provider to enable ClearPath mainframe to encrypt and decrypt the files/elements on its system. Designed the Cipher API Windows Test Tool. This test tool is implemented by Visual C++ and Microsoft CryptoAPI. With this tool to test and verify, the Cipher API products on the Unisys mainframe are proved by NIST to meet its Cryptography standards requirement. Designed and completed a basic mode Cipher API subsystem. This subsystem enables ClearPath system's legacy languages COBOL, FORTRAN, PLUS and MASM to support major cryptography algorithms. Software Engineer 4 Worked as a major member of System Control group to design, develop and implement several applications to support ClearPath OS system and Unisys VOD (Video On Demand) projects. Implemented Event Table Reporting program to enhance the functionality of the ClearPath IO Arbitrary Device Interface. Completed new statistic functions for the Emulated IO Processor Debugger. This debugger is implemented by Visual C++ to simulate ClearPath IO processor on Windows system. I got one of Unisys Patent Application Invention Award for this product with other coworkers.
