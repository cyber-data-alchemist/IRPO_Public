Software Engineer

Joined Backup Express group during its initial expansion.
Backup Express is a client-server network based high-performance backup product for the enterprise.
Hands-on involvement in all phases of SDLC.
Group's resident C/C++ and Unix guru, and 'go to' problem solver, grew to become de-facto lead engineer in team projects.
Took initiative to bring in new technology tools to improve group performance.
Traveled domestically and abroad to large customer sites to provide onsite solutions.
Key Results: Architected a new feature where fine grained privilege classes were to be retrofitted to the product which other engineers implemented.
Led numerous design and implementation meetings.
Led a team of engineers during a high-profile onsite visit to an external company's proving ground.
Drove the team to achieve trip objectives through a five day around the clock effort.
Architected and built a sophisticated automated product build system that gave high visibility to the current state of development.
The 'nightly build' greatly freed up engineering time by automatically provisioning product packages that can easily be tested against and deployed, as well as providing developers with feedback if the code commits are valid on all supported (over 20) platforms.
Designed an IDL (Interface Definition Language) for remote procedure calls amongst modules written in different languages.
Wrote an IDL compiler to generate stubs in C/C++/Java.
This IDL was then used extensively in Backup Express and greatly accelerated product development by enabling the modules to easily communicate with each other.
Designed and implemented real-time multi-threaded transactional framework for implementing application logic atop a legacy database.
Designed and implemented an encryption/decryption and key management subsystem.
Designed and implemented a wizard like Java Swing application to automate device discovery and configuration.
Developed various utilities and tools using UNIX shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, MySQL, GNU make, lex/yacc.

Academic Projects
THERMAL MODELING OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY PACKS:
 ANSYS FLUENT was used to run simulations of the transient temperatures in a 15-cell lithium iron phosphate battery pack for an unmanned ground vehicle under worst case power draw conditions. These simulations were conducted to determine the risk of thermal runaway and to explore what changes might be made to better manage the battery pack temperatures. I designed the battery pack in AUTOCAD 2010 and ran the simulations in ANSYS, The CFD simulation adequately modelled the worst case scenario with a power draw of 3,600 watts at roughly 85 amps and determined the temperature distribution in the pack over time. The analysis revealed that the batteries reached 65.6C after 630 seconds of peak power usage
CFD ENGINE SIMULATION USING ANSYS(FLUENT):
Conducted Heat transfer analysis inside a catalytic converter, considering different inlet geometries, different ideal load conditions, and also considering different porosities and catalyst materials to obtain better results.        Presented results of Simulation of a non- premixed turbulent flame inside a burner, considering different grid densities, high discretization models and altering the geometry of the inlet.
OMNI DIRECTIONAL MOVING TROLLY FOR MATERIAL HANDLING:  
Design and fabrication of four wheel chassis for material handling Develop a gear mechanism to have rotating base for all the four wheels powered by a single motor Design of the control button from center .steering all the four wheels to the required position.

Montgomery Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 (555) 432-1000 resumesample@example.com
Summary
18 year Drilling Fluids Engineer with consulting services for the last four years. Very proficient, safe, and economic use of numerous SBM, OBM, WBM, ""Advanced Fluid Systems"", Completion Fluids, and Packer Fluids of MiSWACO, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes serviced to many Operators. All well locations are treated as ""high profile"" with an aggressive approach of providing the most efficient and proactive treatments, but also a very high focus on Safety and the Environment while keeping minimal logistical issues possible with insightful communication.

My last two years' of assignments has been with MiSWACO working the Rheliant, WARP 4200, and Megadril P Systems. These locations have been in the Gulf of Mexico on Semi-Submersibles and SPAR Platforms in water depths over 5,000', in the Ohio Utica Play for a multi-well ERD Pad Site, and inside Saudi Arabia for a Deepwater Project in the Red Sea that utilized the Rheliant SBM. This single well had zero mud related issues. The Manifa Field assignments were Land and Offshore based. The mud system utilized was a “barite free, clay free” WBM System. Zero issues were encountered and no off bottom circulating was needed to keep the wellbore clean. Faster ROP track record than previous wells drilled. Previous wells needed to be ""pumped out of hole"", but these were able to be slugged and pulled ""dry"".

Summary of Qualifications

All well locations are treated as ""high profile"" with an aggressive approach of providing the most efficient and proactive treatments, but also a very high focus on Safety and the Environment while keeping minimal logistical issues possible with insightful communication.

My last two years' of assignments has been with MiSWACO working the Rheliant, WARP 4200, and Megadril P Systems. These locations have been in the Gulf of Mexico on Semi-Submersibles and SPAR Platforms in water depths over 5,000', in the Ohio Utica Play for a multi-well ERD Pad Site, and inside Saudi Arabia for a Deepwater Project in the Red Sea that utilized the Rheliant SBM. This single well had zero mud related issues. The Manifa Field assignments were Land and Offshore based. The mud system utilized was a “barite free, clay free” WBM System. Zero issues were encountered and no off bottom circulating was needed to keep the wellbore clean. Faster ROP track record than previous wells drilled. Previous wells needed to be ""pumped out of hole"", but these were able to be slugged and pulled ""dry"".","HSE Awareness

ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Induced Overexpression of Transformed E. coli Protein and Protein Purification Assays— Genetic engineering and Analytical chemistry
Over a span of 3 months, I targeted a particular genomic sequence within a specific lineage of E. coli cells. Using oligonucleotide primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), I cloned fragments of DNA that contained the target sequence. Through restriction enzyme digestion and subsequent ligation into the MCS of the designed and manufactured plasmid vector. I was able to transfect a separate target E. coli strain using electroporation and heat shock treatments. With a sequence encoding for an antibiotic resistance induced into the genetically modified bacterial strains, I selected for these cell lineages that both encoded the resistance and the target protein sequence. After exposure to transcription factors, constitutive production of my target protein was achieved. Additionally, I used DEAE anion exchange amongst other commonly used protein purification methods to isolate my genetically engineered/ man-made target protein (alkaline phosphatase). Finally, a kinetic analysis was performed to verify that the target protein was indeed isolated and functional. This assay verified the success of this methodology of genetic engineering.
