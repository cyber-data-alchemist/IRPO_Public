Some of my duties included performing manual chest physiotherapy on our Cystic Fibrosis population, as well as cleaning equipment such as the PB 840, Respironics V60, Oscillator 3100A/B, and INO vents. In addition to cleaning these machines, I also perform the equipment functioning tests and set them up for patient use. Also, I am required to take the thermistor probes to central sterile. I also stock the critical care units, as well as bringing the therapists anything they might need throughout the day, i.e. if a therapist was running a code and they needed a ventilator brought to them.
Crew Member, 04/2009 - 07/2012
College Hunks Hauling Junk And Moving – Tomball, TX
Crew member is a general term at Trader Joe's. As a crew member, we do everything in the store. I checkout customers at the register, handle money, stock shelves, accept truck loads, bring the pallets into the back room, cleaning up messes, getting price checks, and checking up on product status'. With this job, I am used to waking up extra early because our earliest shift is 4am. Our number one concern in this job is customer satisfaction.
Cashier, 08/2008 - 05/2009
The Hertz Corporation – Toledo, OH
As a cashier, I would check out customers on the register, have nightly duties like cleaning, putting back products that customers didn't want. I also dealt with customer service, i.e. customer returns/exchanges.

Lithia Motors – Bellevue, WA
I was the cashier at the service/parts counter in the evenings. I accept payments for the services they had done at the dealership, I would count out the cash drawer at the end of the night, greet customers, and after the service counter closed, I would go to the front to answer phones and take messages.
Cashier/Front End Office Assistant, 04/2005 - 02/2008
Food Lion – City, STATE
I started out at Food Lion as a cashier. I rang up customers, accepted payments, dealt with money, put back unwanted products on the shelf, ran the truck and stocked the shelves. Then I was promoted to Front End Office Assistant. With that title, I counted down the drawers every night, I dealt with customer service, did returns/exchanges, oversaw that everyone went to lunch and was in charge of any money going in/out of the safe during business hours.

Skills
Familiar with most processing systems on computers
Communication--I have been in a customer service job since I was 16 years old and have greatly improved my communication skills over the course of my working/student career.
Troubleshooting skills- being in home care, I have to be able to speak with a caregiver over the phone and try to identify what's going on--whether it's user error, if the equipment is malfunctioning, or if it's being caused by the patient.","My name is Jessica Mercatante Claire. I am a graduate from J Sargeant Reynolds Community College with an Associates of Applied Science in Respiratory Therapy. I was accepted into their Respiratory Therapy program with a 3.53 GPA and was awarded the honor of being on the Dean's List for every semester, while enrolled. I am currently furthering my education and in the process of receiving my Bachelors of Health Science in Human Services from Old Dominion University. I am currently employed at The Pediatric Connection, which is a home health care company, where I am a full time Respiratory Therapist. I've been able to work on many skills there, like customer focus, patient assessment and understanding the workings of respiratory equipment. I have gained much knowledge of ventilators and oxygen therapies, as well as other therapies like Chest PT when I worked as a Respiratory Care student at Virginia Commonwealth University Health Systems in Richmond, VA. I am always looking to learn more, do more, see more, especially in new jobs. I am outgoing and personable and would love the opportunity to work at Baptist Medical Center.","2015 - Basic Life Support
Complex knowledge of oxygen therapies, lung hygiene therapies, Positive Airway Pressue (CPAP/BIPAP) therapies nebulizer treatments
Knowledge of how to operate and to use ventilators, BIPAP/CPAP, accappella/flutter valves, Pulmonary Function Testing, blood gas sticks
2013 - Registered Respiratory Therapist with NBRC
2013 - Current Respiratory Care license through the state of VA

Compassionate caregiver to neonatal, pediatric and adult patients.","Professional Experience
Registered Respiratory Therapist, 07/2013 - Current
Coxhealth – Kimberling City, MO
I am a pediatric home care respiratory therapist. I write orders to keep current with patient care, perform patient assessments and equipment management. I do the teaching of the equipment to the patient's caregivers, including high tech patients who have a heated trach collar and/or ventilator. We provide home medical equipment like nebulizers, oxygen concentrators, oxygen tanks, air compressors, heated humidifiers, cool mist, ventilators, passy muir valves and much more. Maintaining good patient/caregiver rapport is an important part of the job as well as maintaining the same rapport with coworkers. Keeping up to date with the ever-changing medical conditions of our patients, recording when they have any changes in their care, from hospital visits to medication changes or even weaning of oxygen and other equipment from the home.
