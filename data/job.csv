108,Associate Project Developer,"Borrego is seeking an Associate Project Developer to join our growing team in our Lowell, MA office. We offer a hybrid work environment, allowing you to work remotely 2-3 days a week and from the office 2-3 days a week.
At Borrego, we don’t accept the status quo. We are driven by a culture of teamwork, fearless thinking, and adaptability as we pursue our mission to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy. With more than 850 MW already installed, we’re excited about the “Gigawatt Revolution” happening across our company as we shift from megawatts to gigawatts of clean energy in the coming years.
After 40 years in business, Borrego is a trusted name in the solar industry and well-known for our strong employee culture. We combine the stability and wisdom gained by decades in business with an entrepreneurial spirit. Our employees are driven and animated by the [Link available when viewing the job], an operating framework detailing our mission, vision, strategy, and cultural principles and working systems.
About the Role
The Associate Project Developer contributes directly to the success of the company by effectively and efficiently identifying leads that will turn into project opportunities. The APD is a key support position and is vital to Borrego’s go-to-market strategy in the region they are assigned.
This position is an opportunity to join an outstanding company in a high-leverage role. Our ideal applicant will be a tenacious, determined, creative problem-solver, self-motivated and independent, a great communicator, and highly organized, with the ability to manage numerous tasks in parallel, and to prioritize competing demands.
The Associate Project Developer (APD) contributes directly to the success of the company by effectively and efficiently identifying strategic development opportunities and screening prospective sites that will turn into project opportunities.  The APD is a key support position and is vital to Borrego’s go-to-market strategy.  Our most accomplished APD’s bring an enthusiasm for renewable development, have strong writing, analytical and organizational skills, and a hunger to successfully drive the growth of our pipeline.
Position responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:
Prospecting
Using a GIS-based approach to target land parcels that have high potential hosting capacity for solar and energy storage.  APDs identify and research leads through targeted campaign work, including mailers, phone calls, and other outreach.   Using our Salesforce CRM system, you will document all opportunities and take point on calling landowners and then creating due diligence packages for Project Developers to review.  Once landowner interest has been established, you will successfully transition qualified opportunities to project developers and schedule initial meetings with potential landowners for the Project Developers on your team. 
Project Due Diligence/Entitlement Management
Borrego utilizes a Value Stream Mapping (VSM)  process that takes a lean approach in managing opportunities from initial discovery through to closing.  Project due diligence tasks you will be responsible for include: desktop reviews of potential site characteristics including topography, soil conditions, access, interconnection potential, and the likelihood of wetlands, among other things.  Your management will extend into requesting quotes and releasing additional on-site work such as surveying, wetlands flagging, site walks, etc. Using our Salesforce system, you will update project budgets and create construction requisitions.   In addition, you will be responsible for monitoring and managing the completion of site discovery items that are prepared by subcontractors.   
Market Diligence
Due to the dynamic nature of our industry, ideal projects often evolve over time as new technology is introduced and policy adapts to meet the demands of the regional energy markets.  The APD often plays a key role in spotting these trends and forming a hypothesis on what the future opportunities offer.  Strong analytical thinking and experience building sensitivity models in Excel is a desirable quality for a person in this role.
Additional duties include:
Initiate and send initial LOIs and leases
Follow up with Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) administrators for timely delivery of decision documents
Complete cash flow models to assess the impact of changing cost or incentive conditions on projects
Review RFPs and complete RFP questionnaires to allow Project Developers to assess bid viability
Support the company’s efforts towards continuous improvement and standard process development
Desired Skills and Experience
While no one individual will possess them all, the successful candidate will bring many of the following experiences, skills, and attributes:
Bachelor’s Degree
2 to 5 years’ experience in a quota-based sales role or participation in a formal corporate sales training program
Solar sales or development experience preferred
Experience in proposal writing and/or responding to Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
IT skills – proficient in Microsoft Office, Salesforce experience a plus
Compensation, Benefits, and CultureBorrego uses an internally equitable and externally competitive total cash approach to compensation. Our comprehensive benefits package includes dental, vision, health, life, and disability insurance; 401(k) plan with company match and immediate vesting; continuing education and professional development assistance; access to Borrego’s wellness platform; and self-managed flexible work schedules and time-off policies.

Our employees are trusted to get their work done and are given the freedom to do so when they are their most efficient, creative, and engaged.

Job Overview
You’ll be part of the Amazon grocery team that supports one of Amazon’s busiest services: online grocery orders.

Amazon Fresh offers customers everything from cereal to ice cream to fresh flowers, so you’ll be preparing orders for customers, working in different environments – including refrigerated and freezer spaces for part of your shift.

Go up and down stairs (where applicable)
Handle a variety of products you can buy on Amazon Fresh – including meat and alcohol

Temperature. You’ll work in refrigerated and freezer spaces (as low as -10°F) for up to two hours of your shift, with short breaks every 30 minutes. You’ll be provided with proper safety gear and training.
Noise level. It can get noisy at times. We provide hearing protection if you need it.
Dress code. Relaxed, with a few rules to follow for safety. Comfortable, closed-toe shoes are required.
Why You’ll Love this Job
Stay busy. You and your team are engaged the entire shift.
Schedule options. Depending on where you work, schedules may include full-time (40 hours), reduced-time (30-36 hours) or part-time (20 hours or less), all with the option of working additional hours if needed.

Anytime Pay. You can instantly cash out up to 70% of your earnings immediately after your shift (for select employee groups). Learn more about Anytime Pay.

Duties & Responsibilities
Some of your duties may include:
Receive and prepare inventory for delivery
Use technology like smartphones and handheld devices to sort, scan, and prepare orders
View prompts on screens and follow direction for some tasks
Build, wrap, sort, and transport pallets and packages

631,Senior Software Engineer,"Title:  Senior Software Engineer
Reports to:  Senior Director of Engineering
Location: Anywhere in USA, Canada, or Latin America
 
Job Summary
As a Software Engineer, you will build products to help organizations train their employees and overcome their most pressing people-related problems at scale. You will work with product, design, data, and content teams to build a modern learning platform, scaling usage (and impact) 10-100x in the next year.
 
Role Context
Historically FC primarily offered in-person, one-off training. Over the last five years we have made substantial investments, and have had significant success, transitioning the business to an online, subscription product (AAP). Earlier this year we acquired [Link available when viewing the job], an edtech startup whose leadership development platform was used by leading tech cos like Slack, Airbnb, Pinterest and Intuit. Under the Strive's team direction and leadership, we are doubling down on their technology/product-centric approach and looking to build out a larger product and engineering team.
 
Why We Think This is a Great Opportunity
Interesting Product, Technical and Organizational Challenges – This year we will increase the number of users on Strive's learning platform 100 to 1000x. This will require us to solve a number of interesting product, technical and organizational challenges – whatever your unique interest is, there's likely a good challenge for you to work on.
Impact at Scale – FranklinCovey positively impacts the lives of millions of learners and tens of millions of their direct reports every year – FC's directly teaches 4x as many learners in the US as all US business schools combined! By building out platform integrations for learning and planning in the flow of work, you'll substantially increase the quality of the learning experience and thus improve the skills and experiences of that enormous audience.
Startup Speed, Established Company Security – FranklinCovey's product & tech org is small relative to the company's learner/client scale, so you'll be able to move quickly to build a strategy and ship great products. Unlike a startup, FC is an established (and profitable!) publicly traded company, so you won't worry about the next funding round falling through and a lack of job security.
 
Essential Job Functions
Ideate: Engineers participate early in the product development process. You will review regular quantitative and qualitative research about our clients and learners and weigh in on the product strategy and roadmap.
Collaborate: You will partner with product, data and design to define the product features and functionality to ensure we're building the right thing at the right time and in the right way.
Build: You will ship regularly and iteratively, writing testable, readable and maintainable code.
Review & Architect: As a Senior Software Engineer you will play a leadership role in code reviews for the team, helping set the engineer bar, defining best practices, and weighing in on major architecture decisions.
Support: You will work with the sales, marketing, implementation and support teams to ensure users get the most value from the products you've built.
5-10 years of experience building and shipping high-quality products (years of experience ≠ ability, this is a proxy but not a hard requirement)
Back-end experience with Javascript, Python (Django), or Ruby on Rails and front-end experience with React preferred but not required. We're looking for great engineers and are confident that you can learn the language with time and direction.
Drive to continually improve and share knowledge with your teammates.
Ability and experience mentoring/guiding/developing more junior engineers with code reviews, best practice sharing, and architecture decisions
Experience with performance, security, privacy, accessibility, and localization/globalization preferred but not required.
Experience architecting or refactoring systems of moderate complexity preferred but not required
