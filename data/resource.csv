Accomplishments
Developed unified build system that creates a versioned DAG of dependencies for various languages (C++, Java, Python, R, JS Web applications) and builds and packages all the required components for easy deployment of a single release element. The system allows builds for different languages across different platforms, including Windows, Solaris and Linux Red Hat 5 and 6.

Implemented a SAML based SSO solution for internal and external facing web applications.

Lead the iShares team for 1 1/2 years, reducing the size of the code base by over 70% without losing any existing functionality while adding new functionality at the same time. Updated the code base from 0% unit test coverage to over 80% coverage during this time.
Experience
Lead Software Engineer, 01/2009 to 11/2015
Deloitte – Arlington, VA
Developed a unified Build System to allow language agnostic compilation and packaging of applications. The tool is a multi-threaded application that creates a graph of direct and transient dependencies and performs necessary operations on them, including checking out from various source control systems, compiling and packaging. The tool is optimised to only perform operations when changes occur.
The front end dashboard, called Build Server, utilizes an embedded Jetty, Twitter Bootstrap, Spring MVC and Hazelcast to distribute builds across a number of servers and aggregate build data into distributed build objects for view. Hazelcast handles both the distributed object data and a set of queues and listeners for distributing the build requests.Developed a SAML based SSO platform used by internal and external applications. In implementation of this system, I worked closely with our security team to ensure both our registration and login pages are secure and that our encryption mechanisms are secure. We set up WebServices to retrieve user information both from the web and from our mobile iOS applications. Worked closely with various development teams for application integration and data migration into our registration platform. Test coverage of this system was 93% at the time I moved away from the project.
Directly managed other developers on various projects, primarily on the iShares North America and iShares Latin America web teams. I lead development of the Latin American iShares web sites and created a unified code base between various web sites that were currently in production when I began. This included the iShares US, Brazil and Mexico sites, and later the Chile and Europe sites. I also led the iShares North America web development team for 1 1/2 years during which time I worked closely with the business team to develop requirements, documentation of the web sites, and also with data and QA teams to ensure high data and site quality. I coded both back-end Java architecture and components and front end jsps and web components. Development projects include restyling of web site for the iShares team with completely rewritten front end code and redesigned and optimized back end code, with new code for a number of new services. The front end uses a number of different technologies, including Ajax, Flex, JSP and OO javascript. We also wrote a number of widgets for front end reuse for graphs and charts among other things. I wrote a back end based rules engine that drives how the various pages are configured based on fund data.

EXPERIENCE
04/2008 to PRESENT
SR. PROJECT MANAGER AND SR. BUSINESS ANALYST
Crane Worldwide Logistics
At Thermo Fisher Scientific working in the Digital Technology Delivery team, I work as Portfolio Manager, Project Manager and as a business analyst.
I am responsible for eCommerce Portfolio Management as the lead project manager of a $10M budget to relocate our enterprise data center that houses over 4k host systems ranging from ERP, CRM, Sales Tools, E-Commerce, and other back office applications to AWS cloud and our on premise corporate headquarters.
I recently closed out a project where I forecasted and maintained the budget of $2M, 36 employees, and 1 year duration to re-platform website search for our enterprise e-Commerce website search engine.
I delivered on-time and within budget.
Prior to this I owned the B2B channel operations and portfolio for 66% of our overall web revenue equating to $600M annually at the time.
As owner of the channel portfolio, I organized C & B level summits that defined the roadmap for the year, half or quarter's activities across many functional groups.
Within the portfolio management I established processes and policies for establishing and obtaining budget, setting priorities for the projects that were initialized along with operational enhancements and defect resolution or continuous improvement.
I ensure the business case justifies our spend, has measurable performance metrics to ensure projects delivered are tracking to the forecasted returns or savings for the organization.
I produce business and functional requirement documents using UML, context diagrams and use case diagrams.
I have used DMAIC Six Sigma approaches, Continuous Improvement, Iterative, Waterfall and Agile practices to manage SDLC projects and programs.
I produce waterfall project plans as well as Agile story cards and sprints as my role as a project manager.
I present project charters, forecast and track cross functional budgets and schedule for assets, travel, vendors engagement, licensing, on-shore and off-shore resources.
A cadence of capacity planning for both internal full time employees, temps, and contractors across functional teams like ERP, eCommerce, CRM architects/developers and quality assurance resources.
I have coordinated and conducted stakeholder meetings, touch-base meetings, sprints, summits/strategy/tactical meetings, follow ups, deep dives and status/ROI report outs all where applicable for multimillion dollar projects and operational activities.
05/2001 to 04/2008
SR & STAFF ENGINEER
QUALCOMM
Architected, designed, and implemented systems for large Enterprise projects such as Security Management, CRM, Supply Chain, Employee Management, Issue Tracking, Portal Development, and Document Management.
I managed resources and deliverables for aggressive timelines.
Leading implementation efforts and mentored development staff in best practices, design patterns and principles.
Key player for recommendations and interviewing of candidates for permanent and contract positions (domestic and foreign).
Reviewed quality of deliverables produced by external consulting firms, advising as necessary.
Key Project Accomplishments: Gathered and refined business requirements, translated business requirements into functional requirements including use-cases.
Using Java along with Business Objects implemented and delivered an on-time and on-budget sales tool to track company product presale information needed for marketing and supply chain.
The data captured by the tool identifies the target market, the operator, the infrastructure that the product will be utilized in, what version of hardware and software are a best fit based on the needs of the customer driven by data entered into the tool, the form factors of the manufactured product, the geographical location of the targeted market, sales person information and weekly status of the person that is working the account, customer contact information and other data, and many other aspects that assist our sales, marketing, and business analysts to make future company road map decisions.
Using the popular Documentum (WDK and DFC) Framework I designed automation for many aspects of document management and B2B needs.
Our products have vast amounts of documentation for many different audiences and paradigms such as user manuals, technical specifications, testing procedures and outcomes, as well as some aspects of how to manufacture the products that are designed by Qualcomm.
My system manages the security and audit information around these documents, the lifecycle of the documentation, the workflows associated with the documentation and the notifications sent to Customers, Foundries and Engineers.
This is an internal tool as well as a B2B solution.
To implement this tool I utilized many additional frameworks such as Struts, JSTL, Tiles, Oracle Identity Management, Log4J, WebServices, XML to name a few.
Using Informatica, Business Objects, Oracle 10g with XMLDB I architected and designed a system that extracts data from our engineering design tools, organizes it into 3rdNF ODS, and then ETLs into a Star Schema Data Warehouse.
I report the results of Qualcomm design into a library of reports that are used as a interface for our foundries, lead designers and company executives.
This tool is said to have the ROI of ""the business itself"".
This tool has saved Qualcomm many millions of dollars by exposing design anomalies that would not have been uncovered until our product was fabricated and tested or released to market.
The tool was so important and popular that it has spun off a new business separate but partnered with Qualcomm.
